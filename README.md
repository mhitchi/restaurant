In-class exercise "HotRestaurant"

## User Story

I want to create reservations and waiting lists
so that I can keep contact info for my reservations centrally organized
because the service industry is really flippin hectic.

## User Experience

The user first is prompted to either view tables or make a reservation. The View Tables button will show a list of 5 reservations along with the information for each guest making the reservation. The Make a Reservation button will show a form for the user to fill out including their name, phone number, email, and id. Upon clicking the Submit button on the reservation page, the user's entered information will either be added to a reservation, if there are less than 5 tables reserved already, or else put into a waiting list.
